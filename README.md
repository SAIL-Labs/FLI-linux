# FLI-linux


This is a modified version of software provided by Finger Lakes Instrumentation's (FLI) for interfacing to their cameras.

Changes are minor, but enable use on new linux kernel
- it works for me on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with 4.8.0-39-generic.

I included libfli code for convicence, no changes were needed.
